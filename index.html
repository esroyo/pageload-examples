    <h3>Loading a web site is a gradual process</h3>

      <blockquote>
        It's important to understand that [...] is a gradual process. For better user experience, the rendering engine will try to display contents on the screen as soon as possible. It will not wait until all HTML is parsed before starting to build and layout the render tree. Parts of the content will be parsed and displayed, while the process continues with the rest of the contents that keeps coming from the network.

    <p>Check it out with a page that has lots of content and takes long to be downloaded. Try to scroll down while the page is being downloaded. The display keeps updating, but <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> and <code>load</code> events won't be triggered until the download and parsing of the HTML is finished. There is no direct correlation between the delay on those events and a bad score on metrics like FCP, LCP, CLS or TBT.</p>
