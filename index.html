    <h2>📝 Loading a web site is a gradual process</h2>

      <blockquote>
        It's important to understand that [...] is a gradual process. For better user experience, the rendering engine will try to display contents on the screen as soon as possible. It will not wait until all HTML is parsed before starting to build and layout the render tree. Parts of the content will be parsed and displayed, while the process continues with the rest of the contents that keeps coming from the network.

    <p>Let's demonstrate that fact by loading a page with lots of text content. Page download is throttled by the server and takes a long time.</p>
    <p>Try to scroll down while the page is being downloaded.</p>
    <p>The display keeps updating, but <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> event won't trigger until the download and parsing of the HTML is <em>completed</em>.</p>
    <p>There is no <em>direct</em> correlation between the delay on those events and a poor core web vitals score. Although the page is loading, LCP will happen soon enough. This doesn't mean the "performance" of the page is good.</p>

    <h2>📝 External styles block rendering, but not HTML parsing</h2>
    <p>As we have seen in the previous example, the DOM content tree is gradually builded as the HTML is downloaded. What if we have an stylesheet link on that page?</p>
    <p>An external stylesheet by itself does not block <em>all</em> of the process. The fetching of the stylesheet starts, but the HTML parsing continues. The <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> event will trigger regardless the fetching of the style state.</p>

    <p><em>However</em>, although the <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> event fires, <strong>the page won't be displayed to the user</strong> until the fetching of the style is done.</p>

    <h2>📝 Fast styled rendering, with inline styles</h2>

    <p>We can achieve the gradual rendering effect seen on the <a href="#basic-html">first example</a> while displaying already styled content. It is possible by inlining the contents of the stylesheet.</p>

    <p>Although inlining styles is a limited option (prevents caching, is difficult to scale),
    for the shake of the example It is cool to see how the browser can build the DOM and render styled contents as the HTML is dowloaded.</p>

    <h2>📝 Sweet spot: inline critical styles</h2>

    <p>The best experience comes when only <a href="https://css-tricks.com/authoring-critical-fold-css/" target="_blank">critical styles</a> are inlined, as we get the gradual rendering effect of styled content.</p>

    <p>However It forces the loading of the non-critical styles on a deferred stage. The <code>media</code> attribute <a href="https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadCSS" target="_blank">trick</a> is a well known option for the deferred load. Although It feels hackish and relies on JavaScript.</p>

    <p>Another possiblity would be to put the non-critical styles in a <code>link rel="preload"</code> tag. That <code>link</code> wouldn't block document parsing nor rendering. Finally place the regular <code>link</code> to the same style at the very end of the <code>body</code>. Rendering can't be blocked if something has been already painted.</p>

    <p>This would be a sweet spot solution, except for the quirk commented on the <a href="#basic-html-style">external styles example</a>. Blink blocks the document parsing when it finds a style <code>link</code> in the <code>body</code>. Thus although the visual exeperience is good, the delay of <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> makes this solution non-generalizable.</p>

    <p>As we have seen <a href="#basic-html-style">previously</a>, and external stylesheet will not block the document parsing. However if the external style is followed by an script, things change.</p>
   
    <p>An script not only pauses the document parsing, but also requires to finish the <em>ongoing</em> styles loading. Only then will start its execution.</p>

    <p>So document parsing becomes blocked when it gets to an script. In turn the script execution is blocked by the loading styles.</p>

    <h2>📝 Deferred scripts don't block parsing</h2>

    <p>Even though deferred scripts don't block document parsing and get downloaded in parallel (with low priority), they share some key behaviours with the "normal" synchronous script tags:
      <ul>
        <li>They are executed in the order they were found in the document.</li>
        <li>They must wait for ongoing styles loading (if any) to end.</li>
        <li>They are executed before <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> event.</li>
        <li>They don't block rendering. (see <a href="https://esroyo.github.io/pageload-examples/examples/basic-html-script-defer/" target="_blank">secondary example</a>)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>They are all executed at the same time, before <code>DOMContentLoaded</code>. Therefore all deferred scripts need to be completely downloaded before any of them can execute.</p>
